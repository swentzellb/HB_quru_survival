# HB_quru_survival
Code to analyze environmental and individual factors influencing QURU seedling survival at Hubbard Brook

Order of file organization: prelim, Initial_HB_Survival_Enviro_July2020, survival_initial_calc, stat_modeling, figures, figures_2020data, survival_calculations, survival_calculations_JM, survival_calculations_JM_Jan21, survival_modeling, winter, survival_calculations_winter, survival_calculations_Mar21, winter_figures, ShrubCover2020

winter = data cleaning and preliminary analysis of winter climate variables from Hubbard Brook 

survival_modeling = initial GLMM of seedling survival at Hubbard Brook across multiple years

survival_calculations_winter = GLMM of seedling survival across multiple years + winter climate data as explanation of random effect of year variable

winter_figures = GLMM of seedling survival across multiple years + winter climate data as explanation of random effect of year variable and finalized figures of winter climate vars

survival_calculations_Mar21 = up to date GLMM of seedling survival at Hubbard Brook across multiple years with individual characteristisc as fixed predictors + model testing + figures of various models

ShrubCover2020 = comparing shrub cover data from summer 2019 and 2020 

figures_2020data = finalized figures of seedling survival data w/ environmental factors & individual characteristics
